## WTF is COBOL?

>An aging programming language known as COBOL underpins much of the U.S. financial industry, but it has fallen out of favor among coders. This sets up a problem when systems run into glitches or need updates, and companies no longer have COBOL experts on hand."

COBOL (aka Common Business-Oriented Language)=) was invented by Rear Admiral [Grace Hopper](http://www.women-inventors.com/Dr-Grace-Murray-Hopper.asp), a mathematician, programmer, and all-around badass bitch.

## WHY SHOULD I CARE ABOUT SOME OLDASS LANGUAGE WRITTEN BY SOME RANDOM DEAD WOMAN?

    - 43 PERCENT of banking systems are built on COBOL
    - 80 PERCENT of in-person transactions use COBOL
    - 95 PERCENT of ATM swipes rely on COBOL code

Lots of reasons but COBOL is certainly not dead, just forgotten. The code lives on.

## OKAY LET'S LEARN IT
So the purpose of this project...
As a data engineer, COBOL was one of the first programming languages developed for data processing and I want to study it for I guess.. curiosity's sake? Kind of like programming archaeology. There aren't many resources out there but for a start, I found a course on LinkedIn Learning called Learning COBOL by Peggy Fisher. Thought it might be too much of a deep dive if I went into books at the beginning.  I'm pushing my notes/learnings to this repo in case anybody else out there is interested in the content.

Part of me thinks maybe this is a stupid waste of time..
but I treat this as an homeage to one of the pioneers in computing as I believe it's important
to honor Grace Hopper's legacy and representation of women in computing.
Maybe when I get sick of keeping up with all the new shite in this industry, I'll sunset my career
into maintaining old shite legacy COBOL. Plus i'm stuck in quarantine so why the fuck not.

Lastly a really good PyCon talk on the history of programming languages, including
an explanation on the fall of COBOL.
